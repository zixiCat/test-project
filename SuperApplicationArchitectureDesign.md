As you can see from the image above, To Implement the super application mentioned in the question, Technically, the two main points are "WebView"ï¼Œand "JavaScript Engine".First, we&apos;ll develop a basic app, Then we can use Webview to load third-party web link, this is one of method to provide various third-party services for our app.
The performance of WebView is not high, it depends on the browser core, and sometimes native APIs don&apos;t support it ideally either. To address these issues, we can use "JavaScript Engine" like JavaScriptCore, Rhino. JavaScript has a good, and huge ecosystem, it can save a lot of development costs.
In this module, developers can use the agreed, JavaSript-like language to complete a mini program and use special compilers to make its code work in our app.
When the development is complete, developers can publish it to a Audit platform and then to the cloud If the audit is approved, Once they are published to the cloud, our super app can load them.
About the release of surper app, one is the traditional method that is to sent it to app store, but it&apos;s difficult to achieve hot updates or hotfix. here, we can use module replacement. For example, if the app has a bug in module A, we can send an A module containing a fix patch to clound, and it will be loaded preferentially when restarts. In this way, we can provide the updated version quickly to the customer.  Of course, there are many ways to achieve hot updates and hotfix.
